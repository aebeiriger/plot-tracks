3,Likely PLLe,R,,-1,None,,-1,,CEN,t<91 gets nebulous; re-confirm track,clear until t=222 slice 164,t=185-174; slice 173 dipping ventral?,200; slice 191?
26,From Track 3,R,,-1,None,,-1,,CEN,t=222 z=164 where i think cell might be going,,,
4,Facial Neuron,R,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,t<45 gets nebulous; re-confirm track,clear until t=298,,
5,NOTOCORD,M,M,-1,None,,-1,,NOTO,Loops through time; convergent extension movements evident in first half of time series,,,
6,Facial Neuron,R,,-1,Apical C-Div,,8,,FBMN/REN,Check t=290-291 z=188 weird split cells,t=211/210; slice 173 (likely dips ventral; at t=193 probably at slice 164) and t=176 slice 187 and prior,t=90 and slice 218 and prior,t=158 slice 205 track cells to right; probably become FBMNs
7,Part of #6 trajectory,R,,65,Apical C-Div,,8,,FBMN/REN,Track 8 is daughter cell,,,
8,Sister of #6/7,R,,65,Apical C-Div,,7,,ISL1(-),,,,
9,Part of #8 trajectory,R,,-1,None,,7,,ISL1(-),Starts t=268; gets nebulous before t=333,,,
10,Facial Neuron (Front),L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Good until t=250 z=181; nebulous before that,,,
11,Part of #10 trajectory,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Starts t=245,,,
13,Facial Neuron,R,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,left off tracking t=290-291 slice 174,,,
14,Facial Neuron,R ,,112,Non-Apical,,15,,FBMN/REN,pretty close to 13 for t=410- worth clarifying,iffy between 222-190,,
15,Sister of #14,R,,112,Non-Apical,,14,,ISL1(-),t=258-270 is iffy; double check around z=215,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Facial Neuron,R,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,combines with cell #4 at t=274; z=175 - looks like track #4 likely to be wrong,,,
18,Part of #16 trajectory,R,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Ugh rough before t=70,Track stops t=55 slice 221,,
19,Facial Neuron,R,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Lost track at t=145 slice 152 and before ,,,
21,Facial Neuron,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Seems to become the same cell as #11 at t=210 z=167-180,pick up track now that #11 is #22,,
22,Part of #10,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Picks up at t=245 slice 180 like track #11; but likely more accurate,gets nebulous around t=161... too low...?,,
23,Facial Neuron,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Pretty solid track throughout!,,,
24,Facial Neuron,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,Lost track at t=182 slice 159 and before ,,,
25,Facial Neuron,L,,-1,None,,-1,,FBMN/REN,t=253-255 a division? slice 158,,,
